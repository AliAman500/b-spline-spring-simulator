# 3D B-Spline Spring Simulator

This project was developed as part of a Computer Graphics course assignment in university. The objective was to simulate a 3D B-spline spring, allowing users to control its compression, stretching, and various other parameters in a 3D space.

## Features

- **Simulate Spring Compression and Stretching:**
  - Adjust the spring's compression and stretching interactively using the sliders.
  
- **Increase Spring Coils:**
  - Dynamically increase or decrease the number of coils in the spring using the UI.

- **Increase Radius of the Spring:**
  - Dynamically increase or decrease the decrease the radius of the spring using the UI.

- **Camera Controls:**
  - Rotate the camera around the spring in 3D space.
  - Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

## Build and Run Instructions

To build and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository:**
   - Download the repo as a ZIP file and unzip it to your desired location.

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Launch the project by opening the `dev.code-workspace` file in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Configure and Build:**
   - Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
   - Run the "Configure" task to set up the build environment.
   - Run the "Build" task to compile the project. This will output the `app.exe` file into the `build/bin/` folder.

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Navigate to the `build/bin/` folder and launch `app.exe` to start the 3D B-spline spring simulation.

## Tools Used

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLFW**
- **ImGui** (for UI controls)
